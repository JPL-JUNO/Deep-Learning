\section{什么是回归？}
There are two important components of regression: the \textbf{relationship} between independent and dependent variables, and the \textbf{strength} of impact of different independent variables on dependent variables.
\section{Prediction using linear regression}
The bias term allows our regression model to provide an output even in the absence of any input; it provides us with an option to shift our data for a better fit.
